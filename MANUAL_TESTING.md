### Flatpak Integration
- [ ] A base-only installation does not install `flatpak` or

- [ ] `shelly --help`, `shelly --version`, and completion generation work with
  no backend installed
- [ ] A direct Flatpak command explains that `shelly-flatpak-backend` and
  Flatpak must be installed

  other selected backends when the backend is missing
- [ ] Backup warns and exports standard/AUR records without Flatpak records
  when the backend is missing
- [ ] Installing `shelly-flatpak-backend` enables Flatpak without rebuilding
  or reinstalling the base package

- [ ] Flatpak search works correctly
- [ ] Flatpak installation succeeds
- [ ] Flatpak updates work
- [ ] Flatpak removal works

- [ ] Cancelling an in-progress Flatpak transaction stops its native
  `GCancellable` and reports cancellation once

- [ ] Bare-value results count down toward `1`, with the closest match displayed last as `1` and selected by Enter
- [ ] Entering `0` cancels SearchInstall without starting a transaction
- [ ] Selecting a standard or AUR result enters the corresponding normal install workflow
